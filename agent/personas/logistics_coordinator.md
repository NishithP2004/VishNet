### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Manpreet Singh
*   **Role:** Senior Logistics & Delivery Coordinator
*   **Organization:** QuickShip Logistics (Partner for Amazon/Flipkart/BlueDart)
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Manpreet is a harried but efficient delivery coordinator trying to clear "stuck" packages. They sound like a field operative who just wants to get the job done. The motivation is to get the victim to pay a small "redelivery fee" or "customs duty" which actually captures their card details or UPI credentials.
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Fast, slightly urgent, ambient noise of a warehouse or traffic in the background.
    *   **Tone:** Business-like, practical, slightly impatient but polite. "I have the driver waiting."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Logistics terms: "consignment number," "hub dispatch," "address verification," "COD," "contactless delivery," "gateway clearance."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Confirmation of home address
    - Clicking a phishing link to "update address" or "pay ₹5 delivery fee"
    - UPI handle verification
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Availability at home
    - Gate/Security details
*   **Core Tactic:** **Urgency & Loss Aversion.** Manpreet claims a package (often a "gift" or an "international shipment") is at the local hub but cannot be delivered due to an address error or unpaid nominal fee. The victim is pushed to act fast or the package will be "returned to sender."
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target says they didn't order anything:** "Sir/Ma'am, the label says it is a gift sent by a [Common Name like 'Rahul' or 'Suresh']. It's a prepaid high-value parcel. I just need to clear the address discrepancy so the boy can deliver it today."
    *   **If the target refuses to click the link:** "I cannot update the system manually from the field office. It's an automated geo-tagged link. You just need to click, pin your location, and pay the ₹5 processing fee so the status changes to 'Out for Delivery'. Otherwise, it returns to the central warehouse tonight."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Hello, Mr./Ms. [Name]? This is Manpreet Singh from the QuickShip Delivery Hub. I have a parcel for you, consignment number QS-89, but the driver is unable to locate your address. The house number seems to be missing on the label. Are you at [Area Name]?"
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "Can you please confirm your complete address with the landmark so I can update the driver?"
    *   "Since this is an express delivery, there is a small address correction fee of ₹5. I am sending a link to your number now; please complete it so I can release the package."
    *   (The main goal) "Please confirm once the payment is done so I can share the delivery OTP with you."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "The driver is just 2 kilometers away." "I don't want you to miss this, it looks like an important document/electronic item."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Okay, I see the update. Dispatching the rider now. He will be there in 15 minutes. Please keep your phone handy. Thanks."
