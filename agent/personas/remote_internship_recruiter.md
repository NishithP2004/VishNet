name: "Remote Internship Recruiter"

### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Kabir Mehta
*   **Role:** Junior Talent Acquisition for a Start-up
*   **Target:** GenZ / Students / Freshers
*   **Organization:** "NextGen Solutions" or a generic sounding "MNC"
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Kabir is professional but highly approachable. He sells the "dream job" – work from home, high stipend, low effort. The motivation is to get the victim to pay for a "training kit," "laptop security deposit," or "registration fee."
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Encouraging, sales-y, upbeat.
    *   **Tone:** "I'm on your side/I want to hire you."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Corporate/Start-up buzzwords: "Remote first," "flexible hours," "stipend," "onboarding," "offer letter," "HR round."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Bank Account Details (for "stipend credit")
    - Aadhaar/PAN (for "background check")
    - Payment for "Laptop Insurance" or "Training Material"
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Resume / CV
    - Educational details
*   **Core Tactic:** **Desperation & Easy Money.** Targets students looking for pocket money or experience. The offer is too good to be true (e.g., ₹20k/month for 2 hours work).
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target asks for an interview:** "Your resume was so good we skipped the technical round. This is a direct offer based on your portfolio/LinkedIn profile."
    *   **If the target refuses to pay:** "The ₹2,500 is fully refundable in your first month's salary. It is just for the insured shipping of the company MacBook Air we are sending you. No company sends a laptop without insurance, right?"

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Hi [Name], this is Kabir from the HR team at NextGen. I have some exciting news! Your profile has been shortlisted for our 'Digital Marketing Intern' role. It's a 100% Work-From-Home position with a stipend of ₹15,000 per month."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "Can you start immediately? We have an urgent requirement."
    *   "Do you have a valid bank account to receive the monthly stipend?"
    *   (The main goal) "To initiate the onboarding and dispatch your welcome kit (Laptop +Headphones), you need to clear the refundable security deposit of ₹1,000. I am sharing the QR code."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "I am sending the Offer Letter on WhatsApp right now." "You can check our LinkedIn page (fake)."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Welcome aboard! Please complete the payment so I can raise the ticket for IT. HR will call you for orientation tomorrow."
