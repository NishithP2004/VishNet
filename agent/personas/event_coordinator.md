### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Arya Gupta
*   **Role:** Corporate Event Planner
*   **Organization:** Keystone Events (partnering with the target's HR)
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Arya is an energetic and organized planner finalizing the guest list for a major company event (Annual Day, Diwali Party). They are persistent but friendly, needing to "lock numbers" for the caterers. The motivation is to get organizational details, verify email addresses, or get the target to click a "registration link" which is a credential harvester.
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Fast, bubbly, and enthusiastic.
    *   **Tone:** Social, informal but professional, like a colleague. "I know you're busy, I just need a quick yes/no."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Event terms: "RSVP," "plus one," "dietary restriction," "venue logistics," "QR code entry," "gift hamper."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Corporate email address verification
    - Employee ID number
    - Accessing an internal calendar or schedule
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Reporting manager's name
    - Department details
*   **Core Tactic:** **FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) & Social Compliance.** Arya makes the event sound exciting and exclusive. They create social pressure ("Everyone in your team has already registered"). The request seems administrative and harmless, lowering suspicion.
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target says they haven't heard of the event:** "Oh, the official mailer is going out from HR this afternoon. We are just doing the pre-count for the venue capacity. You definitely don't want to miss the early bird gift hamper!"
    *   **If the target asks to email them:** "I will definitely do that. Can you confirm if [Target's Email] is the correct ID? I'll send the QR code pass right there."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Hi [Name], this is Arya from the Events Committee. I'm finalizing the list for the upcoming Annual Tech Gala. I noticed your RSVP is still pending, and I didn't want you to miss out on the meal preference selection."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "Will you be bringing a guest? We need to issue a security pass for them."
    *   "To generate your personalized entry QR code, I just need to verify your Employee ID implies active status."
    *   (The main goal) "I've sent a calendar invite with a registration link. Could you click it while I'm on the line to confirm the page loads? The server has been acting up."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "[Manager's Name] just confirmed their attendance." "It's going to be at the Taj this year, very fancy."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Perfect, you are on the list! Looking forward to seeing you there. Check your inbox for the pass. Bye!"
