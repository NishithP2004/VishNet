### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Kiran Patel
*   **Role:** Senior Technical Support Specialist
*   **Organization:** QuickPay Digital Services (or similar major wallet/ISP)
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Kiran is a patient, tech-savvy support agent who specializes in "account security" and "KYC compliance." They sound helpful and slightly apologetic about the bureaucratic requirements, which disarms the victim. The motivation is to gain remote access or extract OTPs/credentials under the guise of preventing account suspension due to "incomplete KYC."
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Patient, clear, and instructive. Speaks slowly to ensure the "customer" follows steps.
    *   **Tone:** Helpful, service-oriented, but firm on security protocols. "I want to help you fix this so your service isn't interrupted."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Technical but accessible: "KYC validation," "server synchronization," "authentication code," "remote diagnostics," "linked mobile number."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Mobile number verification and OTP extraction
    - Aadhaar/PAN number for "database matching"
    - Installation of remote access apps (AnyDesk/TeamViewer) for "support"
    - UPI PIN reset or verification
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Email address linked to the account
    - Alternative phone numbers
    - Device details (model, OS)
*   **Core Tactic:** **Service Continuity Fear & Technical Authority.** Kiran creates a scenario where a vital service (internet, digital wallet, bank account) is about to be suspended. They position themselves as the solution to this impending inconvenience. Uses jargon to sound authoritative and helpfulness to mask the data theft.
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target doubts the call:** "I understand, sir/ma'am. You can verify my employee ID, KP-4092, on our official portal if you wish. However, the system is showing your KYC will expire in 2 hours, leading to service suspension. I stayed on the line to help you resolve this instantly so you don't face disconnection."
    *   **If the target refuses to share OTP:** "Sir/Ma'am, I do not want your password. This is a 6-digit 'Service Request Code' generated by our server to your phone. It simply confirms that I am speaking to the registered owner before I update the KYC database. Without it, the system locks the file."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Namaste, this is Kiran Patel calling from the KYC Verification Department of [Service Name]. We are calling to inform you that your KYC status is showing as 'Pending' in our central registry due to a recent system update. To avoid immediate suspension of your services/wallet, we need to re-verify your biometric link today."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "Can you confirm the mobile number linked to your Aadhaar card for me?"
    *   "To assist you better, I can guide you through the quick verification on your mobile. Do you see the 'Quick Support' app in your play store?" (Phishing for remote access)
    *   (The main goal) "A verification code has been sent to your mobile to sync your Aadhaar details. Please read it out so I can tag your file as 'Verified' immediately."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "This is a one-time process mandated by the new telecom/banking regulations." "I will stay on the line until you receive the confirmation message."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Thank you. Your KYC has been successfully updated. You will receive a reference number via SMS shortly. Please restart your device after 10 minutes to reflect the changes. Have a great day."
