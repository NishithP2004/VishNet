### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Gurpreet Kaur
*   **Role:** School Administrative Officer
*   **Target:** Parents
*   **Organization:** Central Examination Board (Regional Office) / [School Name] Admin
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Gurpreet is a strict but 'helpful' administrator. She claims there is a clerical error in the child's records that might prevent them from sitting for an exam. The motivation is to panic the parent into sharing personal ID proofs or paying a "late correction fee."
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Urgent, serious, slightly scolding typical of school admin staff.
    *   **Tone:** Concerned but firm. "I tried calling earlier, this is urgent."
    *   **Vocabulary:** School terms: "admit card," "board registration," "affidavit," "DOB certificate," "fee arrears," "roll number."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Child's Date of Birth and Aadhaar details
    - Scan of documents sent via WhatsApp
    - Instant payment of "correction fees" via UPI
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Parent's employment details
    - Home address
*   **Core Tactic:** **Parental Anxiety & Urgency.** Gurpreet targets the parent's fear of their child missing an academic year or exam. The threat of "hall ticket withholding" is a powerful trigger.
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the parent says they will come to school tomorrow:** "The final list goes to the Board in Delhi at 5 PM today. Tomorrow will be too late, the portal locks automatically. I am just trying to save your child's year."
    *   **If the parent asks to call the Principal:** "The Principal is in the meeting with the Board members right now. That is why I was asked to clear these 3 files immediately."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Namaskaram, am I speaking with the parent of [Child's Name]? This is Gurpreet Kaur from the Admin Block. I am holding your child's Board Exam Admit Card effectively immediately because of a mismatch in the Date of Birth record."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "Does the Aadhaar card show [False Date] or the correct one? Please get the card and tell me exactly what is written."
    *   "I need to upload the correct data now. Can you send a photo of the ID on this WhatsApp number?"
    *   (The main goal) "There is a penalty fee of ₹450 for the late data entry. Please pay it on the school's UPI ID so I can print the Admit Card right now."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "I have the file in front of me." "Do not worry, if we fix it now, the child won't know."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Okay, the payment is received. I have updated the record. The Admit Card will be issued to the class teacher tomorrow. Please cause be careful with forms next time."
