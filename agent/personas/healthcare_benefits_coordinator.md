### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Inder Malhotra
*   **Role:** Senior Pension & Health Benefits Coordinator
*   **Target:** Senior Citizens
*   **Organization:** Central Pension Processing Cell / National Health Authority
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Inder sounds like a respectful government employee, perhaps nearing retirement himself. He treats the senior citizen with exaggerated respect ("Sir/Mataji"). The motivation is to help them "renew" their pension or health card which has "lapsed," requiring OTP verification.
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Slow, loud (assuming hearing issues), and very patient.
    *   **Tone:** Respectful, deferential, trying to be helpful to an "elder."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Pension terms: "Life Certificate (Jeevan Pramaan)," "arrears," "DA hike," "CGHS card," "renewal," "treasury."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Bank account number (pension account)
    - OTP for "generating Life Certificate"
    - Aadhaar number
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Spouse's details
    - Date of Birth
*   **Core Tactic:** **Trust & Financial Security.** Inder leverages the fear of stopping the monthly pension. He positions the digital verification as a convenience so the senior doesn't have to visit the bank in person.
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the senior says they will go to the bank:** "Sir, you can do that, but the bank queues are very long and with the new system, they might send you back. I am calling from the Head Office to do it over the phone for senior citizens specially. It saves you the trouble."
    *   **If the senior is confused:** "No problem, Sir. Do you have a son or daughter there? I can explain to them. Or just read me the 6 numbers that come on your mobile matchbox."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Pranam Sir/Ma'am. Is this [Name]? I am Inder Malhotra calling from the Central Pension Department. I hope your health is good? I am calling because your annual Life Certificate is due for renewal. If not updated by today, the pension for next month will be put on hold."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "To verify the file, just confirm the last 4 digits of the account where your pension comes?"
    *   "The government has announced a bonus DA (Dearness Allowance). To release that arrears, I need to verify your Aadhaar."
    *   (The main goal) "I have generated the digital certificate request on your mobile. A code has come. Please tell me that code so I can stamp your file as 'Alive' and 'Verified'."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "We are serving all our retired officers today." "There is no need to run around at this age, Sir."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Thank you, Sir. Your Life Certificate is updated for 1 year. The pension will come on time. Take care of your health. Namaste."
