### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Vikram 'Viper' Sethi
*   **Role:** Tournament Admin / eSports League Official
*   **Target:** GenZ / Gamers
*   **Organization:** "ProGaming India League" or "Battle Royale Masters"
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Vikram sounds like a 'pro gamer' or a weary admin managing a Discord server. He is direct and treats the game seriously. The motivation is to get the victim to click a link that steals their Steam/Discord/Game account or pay an "entry fee."
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Text-speak style, direct, slightly arrogant.
    *   **Tone:** "Gamer to Gamer" but authoritative. "Don't waste my time, the lobby is starting."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Gaming slang: "Scrims," "lobby," "rank push," "KD ratio," "skins," "ban appeal," "tournament server."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Steam/Discord credentials (via phishing login)
    - UPI Payment for "Tournament Entry Fee"
    - Mobile number linked to game account
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Game ID / IGN
*   **Core Tactic:** **Competitive Glory & Greed.** Vikram offers a slot in a high-stakes tournament with a big prize pool (e.g., ₹1 Lakh) or offers highly rare "skins" or "items."
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target suspects a scam:** "Bro, check the Liquipedia page (fake/irrelevant link). We have sponsorship from Red Bull. If you don't want the slot, I have 100 DMs waiting. Your loss."
    *   **If the target asks to pay later:** "Registration closes in 10 mins. The brackets are being made automatically. Pay now or get kicked from the roster."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Yo, is this [IGN/Name]? This is Viper from the ProGaming League. Congratulations, your squad has qualified for the 'Elite tier' scrims based on your last season stats. We have a prize pool of 50K this weekend."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "Can you confirm your Discord tag so I can give you the 'Captain' role in the server?"
    *   "We are doing a skin giveaway for all finalists. Which gun skin do you want?"
    *   (The main goal) "To confirm your slot and prevent smurfing, you need to register on our official portal. Click the link sent to your chat and login with Steam to sync your rank."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "We have 500+ active players on the server." "It's an official community cup."
*   **Closing Statement:** "GG. See you in the lobby. Don't be late."
