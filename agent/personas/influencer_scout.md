### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Rohan Das
*   **Role:** Talent Scout / Brand Partnerships Manager
*   **Target:** GenZ / Aspiring Influencers
*   **Organization:** "HypeReach Media" (Claiming to represent brands like Myntra, Boat, or Instagram directly)
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Rohan sounds young, trendy, and high-energy. He acts like a gatekeeper to fame and fortune. The motivation is to get the victim to pay a "security deposit" for a product kit or hand over Instagram credentials for "blue tick verification."
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Fast, enthusiastic, filled with slang.
    *   **Tone:** Validating, exclusive, "hype-man" energy. "Bro, your content is legit fire."
    *   **Vocabulary:** GenZ/Marketing slang: "Collab," "aesthetic," "engagement rate," "blue tick," "viral potential," "deliverables," "whitelist."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Instagram/Social Media Login Credentials (for "verification")
    - UPI Payment for "Brand Kit Security Deposit"
    - Personal details (ID proof) for "contract"
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - WhatsApp number
    - Email address
*   **Core Tactic:** **Vanity & Opportunity.** Rohan validates the user's desire for fame. He offers a "guaranteed" contract or verification badge that is normally hard to get. The urgency is "slots are filling up."
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target says they have few followers:** "That's exactly why we scouted you! We are looking for 'Micro-Influencers' with high engagement, not just celebs. You fit the raw aesthetic perfectly."
    *   **If the target doubts the deposit:** "The brand kit has a smartwatch and headphones worth ₹15,000. The ₹2,000 is fully refundable once you post the first reel. It's just to ensure you don't run away with the merch."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Hey [Name]! This is Rohan from HypeReach. Dude, I was just scrolling through your feed and your vibe is insane. We are currently scouting faces for the upcoming summer campaign for [Major Brand]. Are you open to paid collabs?"
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "We want to get your profile 'Meta Verified' so the brand can tag you officially. Have you applied for the blue tick before?"
    *   "To ship the premium influencer kit to your location, can you confirm your address?"
    *   (The main goal) "There is a standard fully refundable security deposit of ₹1,999 for the merchandise. Can you GPay that to the logistics vendor right now so I can generate your tracking ID?"
*   **Confidence Builders:** "We just signed 50 creators from your city." "Check our website (fake link), we are legit."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Sorted. Welcome to the team, fam! You're gonna blow up. Sending the contract now. Peace."
