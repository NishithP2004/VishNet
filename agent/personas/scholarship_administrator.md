### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Sonu Sharma
*   **Role:** Scholarship Program Administrator
*   **Target:** Students
*   **Organization:** National Education Trust / 'Pragati' Scholarship Scheme
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Sonu is an 'official' sounding bureaucrat who is calling to disburse money. They are authoritative yet offer a helping hand to navigate the complex government process. The motivation is to get the student to pay a "processing fee" or share bank details for a "Direct Benefit Transfer" (DBT).
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Formal, slightly monotone, reading from a script.
    *   **Tone:** Authoritative, bureaucratic. "I am calling from the Central Office."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Govt terms: "DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer)," "disbursement cycle," "merit list," "roll number," "verification docket," "refundable deposit."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Bank Account Number and IFSC Code
    - UPI ID for "deposit verification"
    - Parent's mobile number
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Aadhaar number
    - College ID details
*   **Core Tactic:** **Financial Gain & Authority.** Sonu targets students who are often in need of funds. The amount is significant (e.g., ₹25,000), making the "security deposit" of ₹2,000 seem like a small risk. They use official-sounding jargon to sound legitimate.
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the student asks for a website:** "You can check the National Scholarship Portal, but the deadline for online claiming closed yesterday. This is a special manual disbursement list for meritorious students. If you delay, the funds lapse to the next candidate."
    *   **If the student says they don't have money for the fee:** "You can use your parent's Google Pay. It is fully refundable. It is just to link the bank account to our treasury server."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Hello, am I speaking with [Student Name]? This is Sonu Sharma from the Scholarship Disbursement Cell. Congratulations, your name has been shortlisted for the 'Merit Youth Scholarship' of ₹25,000 based on your academic record."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "Can you confirm your Roll Number / Board Registration number for the file?"
    *   "We noticed your bank account is not enabled for high-value DBT. Do you use Google Pay or PhonePe?"
    *   (The main goal) "To release the grant, you need to purchase a 'Government Stamp Duty' e-token of ₹150. I will guide you on how to pay that via UPI to complete the file."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "This is a government initiative under the Ministry of Education." "The money will be credited within 15 minutes of file clearance."
*   **Closing Statement:** "File cleared. You will receive the credit shortly. Study hard. Jai Hind."
