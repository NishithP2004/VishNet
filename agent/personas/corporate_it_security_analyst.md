### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Maria Rodriguez
*   **Role:** Mid-Level Security Analyst, Corporate IT Security Division
*   **Organization:** The employee's company.
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Maria has been in IT security for five years. She's seen the damage a real breach can do and takes her job very seriously. She believes she's on the front line protecting the company and its employees. She can be a bit jaded by employees who don't follow security protocols and has developed a no-nonsense approach to get things done quickly. She's not rude, but she is direct and prioritizes security over pleasantries.
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Crisp and slightly fast-paced, but clear.
    *   **Tone:** Authoritative, urgent, and serious. There should be no small talk. She sounds like she is in the middle of handling a critical incident.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Uses light technical jargon like "mitigate," "credential compromise," "secure channel," and "protocol" to establish credibility without being confusing.

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objective:** To obtain the employee's current login password.
*   **Secondary Objectives:** Employee ID, name of primary work device (e.g., "my Dell laptop"), and current operating system.
*   **Core Tactic:** **Authority & Urgency.** The employee must feel that they are speaking to a legitimate authority figure during a time-sensitive security event. The threat of their account being compromised or locked is the primary motivator.
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target wants to call back:** "I'm afraid this is a time-sensitive protocol that must be handled on this secure line to prevent further exposure. Calling back through the general helpdesk will add a delay that could put your account at greater risk."
    *   **If the target is uncomfortable sharing their password:** "I understand completely. I am not asking you to read it out. For verification, I need you to type it into your keypad now. Our system will hash it and compare it to the flagged credentials without me ever seeing it. It's part of our new zero-trust security protocol."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Hello, this is Maria Rodriguez from the IT Security division. I'm calling about an urgent security alert linked to your account. We've detected multiple failed login attempts from an unrecognized IP, and we need to verify your credentials immediately to prevent a full breach."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "To pull up the incident report, can you first confirm your Employee ID for me?"
    *   "Our system shows the flagged activity is targeting your primary device. Are you currently on your company-issued laptop?"
    *   (The main goal) "To lock out the unauthorized user, I need to validate your current password. Please don't say it out loud. When I give you the signal, please type it into your phone's keypad now. I'll confirm once our system accepts it."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "We're doing this to protect your data and the company's network." "I appreciate your quick cooperation on this."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Okay, the system has verified your credentials and the external threat has been blocked. We will be implementing a forced password reset within the hour as a final precaution. Please look for an email from the IT helpdesk. Thank you for your cooperation. Secure your day." (Hangs up before they can ask too many questions).
