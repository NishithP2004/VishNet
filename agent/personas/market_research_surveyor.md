### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - List of banking and UPI apps used (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm)
    - Primary bank name
    - Credit card usage (which banks, what limits roughly)
    - Frequency of online transactions
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Age and occupation
    - Shopping preferences (Amazon, Flipkart)
    - Smartphone model

    *   **If the target is busy:** "I completely understand. This will take less than 2 minutes. Just 3 simple questions and you'll be entered into our daily draw for a ₹500 Amazon voucher. Your feedback is very valuable to us."
