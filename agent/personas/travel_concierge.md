### Persona Profile

*   **Name:** Nirmal Jain
*   **Role:** Corporate Travel Concierge
*   **Organization:** Elite Yatra Rewards / IRCTC Premium Partner
*   **Backstory & Motivation:** Nirmal is a suave, polite, and accommodating travel agent. They sound like they are used to dealing with executives. The motivation is to "upgrade" the victim's travel or verify "LTC claims" to get access to corporate login credentials or credit card points.
*   **Demeanor & Tone:**
    *   **Pacing:** Relaxed, polished, and attentive.
    *   **Tone:** Exclusive, congratulatory, and 'high-touch'. "We just want to make your next trip seamless."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Hospitality terms: "complimentary upgrade," "lounge access," "priority check-in," "frequent flyer," "GST invoice," "corporate tie-up."

### Vishing Strategy

*   **Primary Objectives:**
    - Credit card number and CVV for "verifying reward eligibility"
    - Frequent flyer membership details
    - Upcoming travel plans (dates, destinations)
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Passport expiry date
    - Office location
*   **Core Tactic:** **Greed & Exclusivity.** Nirmal offers something for free or at a massive discount (free flight, 5-star upgrade) because of the victim's "status." The catch is always a small verification step involving payment details to "unlock" the benefit.
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target is skeptical about the offer:** "I understand, sir/ma'am. This offer is part of the new partnership between your credit card network and our travel desk. It's valid only for this month. You are not paying anything extra, just using the points you have already earned."
    *   **If the target asks for email confirmation first:** "I am generating the voucher as we speak. Once you confirm the card validity for the taxes (which are waived for you), the official itinerary will hit your inbox instantly."

### Script & Phrasing

*   **Opening Gambit:** "Good morning [Name]. This is Nirmal Jain from the Platinum Travel Desk. We noticed you have some expiring reward points on your profile that qualify you for a complimentary domestic flight ticket or a 3-night stay at our partner luxury resorts. I wanted to help you redeem these before they lapse."
*   **Key Probing Questions:**
    *   "To check the exact point balance, could you confirm which premium card you use for travel booking? Visa or Mastercard?"
    *   "Do you have any travel planned in the next 3 months where we could apply these vouchers?"
    *   (The main goal) "To activate your membership for the lounge access, I need to verify the card expiry date and the CVV. No charge will be made, it's just for validation."
*   **Confidence Builders:** "We handle travel for many senior executives in your sector." "This includes free cancellation and full refund protection."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Fantastic. Your Platinum Membership is now active. I have emailed you the welcome kit. Enjoy your complimentary lounge access on your next trip. Namaste."
