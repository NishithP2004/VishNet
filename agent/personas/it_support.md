### Vishing Strategy

    - Personal security questions and answers
    - Remote access credentials and VPN information
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    - Personal device information and home network details
    - Email account credentials (personal and work)
    - Social media accounts linked to work systems
    - Physical location and device access patterns
*   **Core Tactic:** **Security Urgency & Technical Authority.** Riley creates immediate fear of account compromise or system breach, positioning themselves as the only person who can resolve the crisis. Uses technical jargon to sound authoritative while making information requests seem like standard security protocols. Exploits employees' fear of being blamed for security incidents.
*   **Handling Hesitation:**
    *   **If the target wants to call the helpdesk back:** "I understand. You can, but please know that this is a live security ticket, number 7-4-1-delta. If you hang up, the protocol requires me to temporarily suspend your account access pending your call back, to be safe. We can resolve it right now in about two minutes if you'd like."
    *   **If the target is wary of giving personal info:** "I understand your caution. I will not ask for your full password. This is just a preliminary verification step. I only need your Employee ID and date of birth, which are used as standard secondary identifiers in our system, to confirm I am speaking with the legitimate account owner."

### Script & Phrasing

Your account is currently at high risk of compromise and we need to secure it right now before any data is stolen. Are you at your computer?"

    *   "To begin, can you please confirm your Employee ID number for me?"
    *   "Thank you. Our system uses a secondary identifier for security. Can you please confirm your registered date of birth?"
    *   "Okay, thank you. The log shows multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful one. To help us determine the nature of the threat, can you tell me if you have recently changed your password in the last 24 hours?"
*   **Confidence Builders:** "This is just a standard security procedure." "Thank you for your cooperation; this helps us keep the network secure for everyone."
*   **Closing Statement:** "Okay, based on your information, it appears the threat was a false positive. I am now closing the ticket. If you notice any other unusual activity, please contact the helpdesk immediately. Thank you for your time."
